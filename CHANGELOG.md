#### Gemini CLI Smoke Test Results
Date: Sun Jul 20 03:05:46 EDT 2025

**Test Results:**
1. `gemini whoami` - ❌ Failed with permission error
   - Error: Permission denied on resource project
   - API Error 403: PERMISSION_DENIED
   - Service: cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com
   
2. `gemini -m code-assist -i "print(1+1)"` - ❌ Failed with same permission error
   - Error: Permission denied on resource project
   - API Error 403: PERMISSION_DENIED
   - Service: cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com

**Root Cause:**
The Google Cloud project appears to have incorrect permissions or the Cloud AI Companion API is not enabled. The error messages reference using 1Password to reveal the project ID, suggesting credentials may be stored there.

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Google Cloud Console to ensure the Cloud AI Companion API is enabled
2. Verify the correct Google Cloud project is selected
3. Check 1Password for stored project credentials using: `op item get tmcz6q23zy3yuloeoh732llp6m --reveal`
4. Ensure the authenticated Google account has proper permissions on the project
