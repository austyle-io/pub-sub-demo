# Phase 7: Advanced Security Hardening

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned
**Target**: Q2 2025
**Dependencies**: Phase 6: Production Deployment
**Objective**: Implement enterprise-grade security features to protect against advanced threats, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide robust user authentication.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

This phase builds upon the foundational security measures by introducing advanced authentication methods, comprehensive threat detection, and stringent data protection controls. The goal is to create a highly secure environment that meets the standards of enterprise customers.

## âœ… **Deliverables**

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A fully integrated MFA system using TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Secure social sign-on with Google and GitHub.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: A real-time threat detection and prevention system.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging and analysis of security events.
- **Vulnerability Management Program**: A continuous process for identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ“‹ **Detailed Task Breakdown**

### 1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** (`4-6 hours`)
- [ ] **Backend Implementation**:
    - [ ] Integrate a TOTP library (e.g., `otplib`).
    - [ ] Add database fields to store MFA secrets and backup codes for users.
    - [ ] Create API endpoints for enabling MFA, generating QR codes, and verifying codes.
- [ ] **Frontend Implementation**:
    - [ ] Develop a user interface for MFA setup and verification.
    - [ ] Display QR codes for easy scanning with authenticator apps.
    - [ ] Implement a flow for users to enter TOTP codes during login.
- [ ] **Recovery Mechanism**: Implement a secure mechanism for users to recover their accounts if they lose their MFA device.

### 2. **OAuth 2.0 Integration** (`6-8 hours`)
- [ ] **Provider Setup**: Register the application with Google Cloud and GitHub to obtain OAuth credentials.
- [ ] **Backend Strategy**:
    - [ ] Use Passport.js with `passport-google-oauth20` and `passport-github2` strategies.
    - [ ] Implement callback routes to handle user authentication and profile retrieval.
    - [ ] Add logic to link OAuth profiles to existing user accounts or create new ones.
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**:
    - [ ] Add "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with GitHub" buttons to the login page.
    - [ ] Handle the OAuth redirect flow on the client-side.

### 3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention** (`5-7 hours`)
- [ ] **Tool Selection**: Choose and configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and IDS (e.g., Cloudflare WAF, ModSecurity).
- [ ] **Rule Configuration**:
    - [ ] Implement rules to block common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
    - [ ] Set up rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- [ ] **IP Blacklisting**: Integrate with a threat intelligence feed to block known malicious IP addresses.
- [ ] **Alerting**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities and potential attacks.

### 4. **SIEM and Security Logging** (`4-6 hours`)
- [ ] **Centralized Logging**: Forward all application and system logs to a centralized SIEM solution (e.g., Datadog, Splunk, or an ELK stack).
- [ ] **Correlation Rules**: Create rules in the SIEM to correlate events from different sources and identify security incidents.
- [ ] **Security Dashboards**: Build dashboards to visualize security events, threats, and trends.
- [ ] **Audit Trails**: Ensure that all sensitive actions (e.g., login, permission changes) are logged in a detailed and immutable audit trail.

### 5. **Vulnerability Management** (`Ongoing`)
- [ ] **Automated Scanning**:
    - [ ] Set up regular vulnerability scans of the application and its dependencies (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot).
    - [ ] Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] **Penetration Testing**: Schedule regular penetration tests with a third-party security firm.
- [ ] **Patch Management**: Establish a process for quickly patching vulnerabilities when they are discovered.

## ðŸ§ª **Testing and Validation**

- **MFA**:
  - Verify that MFA can be enabled and disabled successfully.
  - Test the TOTP verification logic with valid and invalid codes.
  - Validate the account recovery flow.
- **OAuth**:
  - Test the sign-in flow for each provider.
  - Verify that user profiles are correctly created or linked.
  - Test error handling for failed authentication attempts.
- **Security Controls**:
  - Use security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) to verify that the WAF and IDS are blocking common attacks.
  - Simulate security events to ensure they are correctly logged and trigger alerts.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**

- **MFA Adoption**: Percentage of users who have enabled MFA.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: A measurable decrease in successful attacks and security incidents.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to relevant security standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR).
- **Time to Remediate**: The average time it takes to patch a new vulnerability.

**ðŸ“‹ Phase 7 Planned** - This phase will significantly enhance the security posture of the application, making it suitable for enterprise and security-conscious customers.
