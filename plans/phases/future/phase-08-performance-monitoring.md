# Phase 8: Performance & Monitoring

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q2 2025
**Dependencies**: Production environment stable
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive performance optimization and monitoring infrastructure

## 🎯 **Overview**

This phase will focus on performance optimization, comprehensive monitoring, and observability. The implementation will include application performance monitoring (APM), real user monitoring (RUM), and performance optimization based on production data.

## 📋 **Planned Deliverables**

### 📊 **Observability Stack**

- **Datadog Integration**: APM, logs, metrics, and RUM
- **Custom Dashboards**: Business and technical metrics
- **Alerting System**: Proactive issue detection
- **SLA Monitoring**: Service level objective tracking

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization**

- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session and document caching
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery optimization
- **Database Optimization**: Query performance and indexing
- **Code Splitting**: Frontend bundle optimization

### 🔍 **Monitoring Infrastructure**

- **Real User Monitoring**: Actual user experience tracking
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Proactive service health checks
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error analysis
- **Performance Budgets**: Automated performance regression detection

### 📈 **Analytics & Insights**

- **User Analytics**: Usage patterns and engagement metrics
- **Performance Analytics**: Response times and throughput
- **Business Metrics**: Document creation and collaboration stats
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource usage and optimization recommendations
