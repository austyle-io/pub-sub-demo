# Phase 9: Enhanced Collaboration Features

**Status**: üìã Planned
**Target**: Q3 2025
**Dependencies**: Phase 8: Performance Monitoring
**Objective**: Transform the basic collaborative editor into a rich, intuitive, and full-featured workspace with advanced collaborative tools.

## üéØ **Overview**

This phase focuses on elevating the user experience by introducing features that are common in modern collaborative suites like Google Docs or Notion. This includes a rich-text editor, a robust commenting system, user presence indicators, and a notification system.

## ‚úÖ **Deliverables**

- **Rich-Text Editor**: A full-featured WYSIWYG editor based on Tiptap.
- **Commenting System**: An inline commenting system that allows users to discuss specific parts of a document.
- **User Presence and Cursors**: Real-time tracking of user cursors and a display of active users.
- **Notification System**: A system to notify users of mentions, comments, and other important events.

## üìã **Detailed Task Breakdown**

### 1. **Rich-Text Editor (Tiptap)** (`8-10 hours`)
- [ ] **Integrate Tiptap**: Replace the current plain-text editor with a Tiptap-based editor.
- [ ] **Toolbar**: Create a formatting toolbar with options for bold, italics, headings, lists, etc.
- [ ] **Custom Nodes**: Develop custom Tiptap nodes for features like code blocks and embedded media.
- [ ] **Markdown Support**: Implement real-time Markdown shortcuts and a Markdown import/export feature.
- [ ] **Data Model**: Update the ShareDB document schema to support the structured JSON format of Tiptap.

### 2. **Commenting System** (`6-8 hours`)
- [ ] **Data Model**: Design a database schema for storing comments, including their position in the document, author, and resolution status.
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints for adding, fetching, updating, and resolving comments.
- [ ] **Frontend UI**:
    - [ ] Develop a UI for displaying comments in the margin of the document.
    - [ ] Create a form for adding new comments and replies.
    - [ ] Implement a mechanism to highlight the text associated with a comment.

### 3. **User Presence and Cursors** (`5-7 hours`)
- [ ] **Backend (WebSockets)**: Use WebSockets to broadcast user cursor positions and presence information in real-time.
- [ ] **Frontend**:
    - [ ] Display the cursors of other users in the document, with their names.
    - [ ] Show a list of avatars of the users who are currently viewing the document.
- [ ] **Performance**: Ensure that the real-time presence updates are efficient and do not degrade application performance.

### 4. **Notification System** (`4-6 hours`)
- [ ] **Backend**: Develop a system for generating and storing notifications (e.g., when a user is mentioned in a comment).
- [ ] **API**: Create an API endpoint for fetching a user's notifications.
- [ ] **Frontend**: Design a UI element (e.g., a bell icon) to display unread notifications.
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Integrate with an email service (e.g., SendGrid) to send email notifications for important events.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Choices**

- **Rich-Text Editor**: **Tiptap** (a headless, framework-agnostic editor that works well with React and ShareDB).
- **Real-Time Communication**: **WebSockets** (already in use for ShareDB).
- **Email Service**: **SendGrid** or a similar provider for reliable email delivery.

## üé® **User Experience (UX) Considerations**

- **Intuitive Interface**: The new features should be easy to discover and use.
- **Unobtrusive Design**: The UI for comments and presence should not clutter the editing experience.
- **Performance**: The editor must remain fast and responsive, even with many collaborators and a large document.
- **Accessibility**: All new UI components should be accessible to users with disabilities.

## üß™ **Testing and Validation**

- **Collaborative Scenarios**: Test a variety of collaborative scenarios with multiple users to ensure that all features work correctly in real-time.
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct usability tests with real users to gather feedback on the new features.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure the performance impact of the new features, especially the real-time presence and cursors.

**üìã Phase 9 Planned** - This phase will deliver a best-in-class collaborative editing experience, making the application competitive with leading products on the market.
