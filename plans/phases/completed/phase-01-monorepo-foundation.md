# Phase 1: Monorepo Foundation

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-20
**Objective**: Establish foundational repository structure and workspace configuration

## 🎯 **Overview**

This phase established the foundational repository structure and workspace configuration so that frontend and backend could be developed in parallel. The phase created the monorepo and scaffolded minimal "Hello World" applications for client and server, verifying that both could be started and tested.

## 📋 **Key Deliverables**

### ✅ **Repository Setup**

- Git repository with proper .gitignore and initial structure
- Initial README and project documentation
- Version control best practices established

### ✅ **Monorepo Architecture**

- Turborepo monorepo with `apps/*` and `packages/*` organization
- Workspace configuration with pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Clean separation of concerns across packages

### ✅ **TypeScript Configuration**

- Base tsconfig and package-specific configurations
- Strict TypeScript settings for quality enforcement
- Proper module resolution across workspace

### ✅ **Development Environment**

- Minimal React client with TanStack Start (port 3000)
- Minimal Express server with health endpoint (port 3001)
- Parallel development configuration with `pnpm run dev`
- Hot reload and development workflow

### ✅ **Testing Foundation**

- Basic test suites for both client and server
- Test runner configuration and CI preparation
- Verified build and runtime functionality

## 🏗️ **Architecture Decisions**

### **Monorepo Structure**

```mermaid
collab-edit-demo/
├── apps/
│   ├── client/          # React frontend (TanStack Start)
│   └── server/          # Express backend
├── packages/
│   └── shared/          # Shared utilities and schemas
├── turbo.json           # Turborepo configuration
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml  # Workspace definition
└── package.json         # Root package configuration
```

### **Technology Choices**

- **Package Manager**: pnpm for performance and workspace support
- **Monorepo Tool**: Turborepo for build orchestration and caching
- **Frontend Framework**: TanStack Start for modern React development
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js for API and WebSocket server
- **Language**: TypeScript throughout for type safety

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Turborepo Configuration**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "dependsOn": ["^dev"],
      "parallel": true
    },
    "lint": {},
    "test": {}
  }
}
```

### **Development Scripts**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel",
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "lint": "turbo run lint"
  }
}
```

## ✅ **Verification & Testing**

### **Manual Testing**

- ✅ Express server starts on port 3001 and responds to `/health`
- ✅ React client starts on port 3000 with TanStack Start
- ✅ Both services run concurrently with `pnpm run dev`
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works across all packages
- ✅ Basic tests pass in both client and server

### **Success Criteria Met**

- [x] Clean monorepo structure established
- [x] TypeScript configuration working
- [x] Development servers start successfully
- [x] Basic testing framework in place
- [x] Build pipeline functional

## 📈 **Impact & Benefits**

### **Development Experience**

- **Unified Workflow**: Single command starts entire development environment
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript configuration ensures consistency
- **Incremental Build**: Turborepo caching improves build performance
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new apps or packages

### **Quality Foundation**

- **Consistent Tooling**: Same linting, formatting, and testing across packages
- **Dependency Management**: Centralized package management with pnpm
- **CI/CD Ready**: Pipeline configuration prepared for automation

## 🔄 **Next Phase Dependencies**

This phase provides the foundation for:

- **Phase 2**: Shared schema definitions can be added to `packages/shared`
- **Phase 3**: Backend API implementation in `apps/server`
- **Phase 4**: Frontend implementation in `apps/client`
- **Phase 5**: Quality tools can be configured across the monorepo
