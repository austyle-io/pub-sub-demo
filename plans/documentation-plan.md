# Documentation Implementation Plan

**Project:** Collaborative Document Editing Demo
**Status:** In Progress
**Owner:** Gemini

## 1. Mission Statement

To create a comprehensive, user-friendly, and easily maintainable documentation suite that enables developers to understand, contribute to, and deploy the application with confidence. This documentation will serve as the single source of truth for the project's architecture, development practices, and operational procedures.

## 2. Proposed Documentation Structure

The documentation will be organized into the following top-level categories, mirroring the structure in the `docs/` directory:

- **01_getting-started:** Onboarding guides for new developers.
- **02_architecture:** High-level system design, component diagrams, and data flow.
- **03_development:** Detailed development workflows, coding standards, and style guides.
- **04_testing:** Testing strategies, frameworks, and instructions for running tests.
- **05_deployment:** Production deployment, infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **99_appendix:** Reference materials, glossaries, and miscellaneous documents.

## 4. Timeline & Priorities

The documentation will be completed in the following phases:

- **Phase 1 (High Priority):** Create all "High" priority documents. This will provide the essential information needed for developers to get started and contribute effectively.
- **Phase 2 (Medium Priority):** Create all "Medium" priority documents and review existing `INDEX.md` files. This will fill in the remaining gaps in the documentation.
- **Phase 3 (Low Priority):** Create all "Low" priority documents. This will provide additional context and reference material.

## 5. Style Guide

- **Tone:** Clear, concise, and professional.
- **Formatting:** Use Markdown with a consistent structure.
- **Code Examples:** Provide clear and well-commented code snippets.
- **Diagrams:** Use Mermaid.js for diagrams and charts.

## 6. Review & Maintenance

- All documentation will be reviewed and approved before being merged.
- The documentation will be updated regularly to reflect changes in the codebase.
