# Collaborative Document Editing Demo

Welcome to the documentation for the Collaborative Document Editing Demo application. This documentation covers everything you need to know about building, deploying, and extending this real-time collaborative editing platform.

## What is Collab Edit?

Collab Edit is a modern real-time collaborative document editing application built with cutting-edge web technologies:

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously with automatic conflict resolution
- **Type-Safe Architecture**: End-to-end TypeScript for reliability and developer experience
- **Scalable Design**: Monorepo structure with shared packages for consistency
- **Secure by Default**: JWT authentication, role-based access control, and document-level permissions

## Quick Start

Get started with Collab Edit in just a few minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/austyle-io/pub-sub-demo.git
cd pub-sub-demo

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Start development environment
make dev
```

Visit [Getting Started](/getting-started) for detailed setup instructions.
