# Session Update: 2025-01-21 Final Status

## ✅ Major Accomplishments Today

1. **Resolved All Critical Blockers**
   - Fixed ShareDB authorization with proper user context
   - Fixed document API endpoints (list, permissions, delete)
   - Fixed rate limiting interference with tests
   - Resolved all ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues

2. **Implemented Key Fixes**
   - **Rate Limiting**: Now conditionally applied based on NODE_ENV
   - **ShareDB Structure**: Corrected document queries and transformations
   - **API Endpoints**: All document operations now working correctly
   - **Testing Infrastructure**: Created helper scripts and documentation

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive lessons learned
   - Created TESTING.md with troubleshooting guide
   - Added test helper scripts for consistent execution

## 🎯 Current Working Features

- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ JWT token management with refresh
- ✅ Document creation via ShareDB
- ✅ Document listing with proper ACL filtering
- ✅ Real-time collaborative editing
- ✅ Permission management (owner, editor, viewer)
- ✅ WebSocket authentication
- ✅ Development environment (local & Docker)

## 📋 Next Steps for Phase 5 (CI/CD)

1. Run full test suite with all fixes
2. Implement ESLint and Prettier configuration
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
4. Generate and validate OpenAPI documentation
5. Clean up debug logging and finalize code

## 🔑 Key Lessons for Future Sessions

### ShareDB Integration

- Document ID is stored in root `d` field, not `_id` or nested
- Data can be in either `create.data` or `data` depending on lifecycle
- Backend connections need explicit user context via `agent.custom`
- Always use `{ d: documentId }` for queries

### Testing & Development

- Rate limiting must be disabled for test environment
- Use `NODE_ENV=test` when running tests
- Add extensive logging during debugging, remove after
- Test API endpoints in isolation before integration

### API Development

- ShareDB documents need careful transformation
- Use try-catch in array operations to handle partial failures
- Always validate data structure before use
- Direct MongoDB queries help understand storage format

The project is now functionally complete for Phase 4, with all major features working. The remaining work focuses on code quality, testing, and CI/CD setup.
