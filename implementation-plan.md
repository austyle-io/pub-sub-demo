Original implementation plan continues below...

========================

Objectives and Agent Overview

This plan describes how an AI agent will bootstrap a collaborative document editing application in a local environment. The agent's high-level goals are to incrementally scaffold the entire project (frontend, backend, and shared components), verify functionality by running tests and dev servers, and enforce code quality ‚Äì all locally (no cloud services) and without deploying to production. Key agent behaviors include:
	‚Ä¢	Structured, Phased Progress: The agent will follow a phased workflow (foundation, integration, etc.) to build the project step-by-step Ôøº. Each phase produces a working increment of the app, minimizing integration issues.
	‚Ä¢	Incremental Commits: After completing each step or phase, the agent will commit code with meaningful messages. This ensures a clear history of how the project was built and allows rollback of any problematic changes if needed (although since this is a new project, the risk is low).
	‚Ä¢	Local Development Focus: The agent will operate on the developer's machine ‚Äì e.g. using local Node.js and a local MongoDB instance (for persistence) ‚Äì rather than any cloud services. It will spin up the development servers and database locally to test functionality.
	‚Ä¢	Automated Testing & Validation: At each stage, the agent runs unit tests (and later integration tests) to validate that the newly added components work as expected. It will also start the frontend and backend dev servers to ensure the environment runs without errors.
	‚Ä¢	No Deployment Step: The scope is limited to scaffold and develop the application. Deployment (to cloud or production) is explicitly out of scope, so the agent stops after local CI checks pass. Continuous integration (CI) is set up to run on GitHub Actions for quality enforcement, but continuous deployment is not configured.

By adhering to these behaviors, the AI agent will rapidly produce a fully functional collaborative editing demo with high code quality, without breaking anything in the process (a strategy similar to prior phased migrations that kept risk low and workflow disruption minimal Ôøº).

Tech Stack and Project Structure

The project uses a TypeScript monorepo (managed with Turborepo) to house all components: a React frontend, a Node/Express backend, and shared code. Using a monorepo ensures end-to-end type safety by sharing types and schemas between client and server Ôøº. The main technologies and how they fit together are:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend (React + TanStack Start + XState): The web client is built with TanStack Start ‚Äì a modern full-stack React framework that builds on TanStack Router for routing and can support server-side rendering (SSR). We will use TanStack Start primarily for its React architecture and routing (with potential to enable SSR in the future). The frontend is written in TypeScript and uses XState for state management. XState will model the collaboration logic (e.g. connection status, editing states) as a finite state machine, improving reliability of complex real-time UI flows. The UI can be kept simple (e.g. a text editor area for the document content and some controls) since the focus is collaborative functionality rather than UI complexity.
	‚Ä¢	Backend (Node.js + Express + ShareDB + MongoDB): The backend is a Node/Express application (TypeScript) that serves two main purposes: a RESTful API (if needed for supporting functionality like document management) and a real-time WebSocket server for collaborative editing. ShareDB (an Operational Transformation engine) is used as the real-time collaboration layer. We will integrate ShareDB into the Express server so that clients can open WebSocket connections for document editing. ShareDB will be configured with a MongoDB adapter for persistence, so all document operations are stored and synchronized via MongoDB. This ensures that document changes are not lost and multiple server instances (if scaled out in the future) could share state via the database.
	‚Ä¢	Operational Transformation (OT) Details: ShareDB uses OT under the hood to handle concurrent edits. By default it uses the JSON0 type (which can handle JSON documents) Ôøº Ôøº. For a text document editor, we can use ShareDB's text OT type (e.g. text0) or a rich text type to handle string operations, but for simplicity in this demo, we might treat the document as a simple JSON object containing a text field (or use text0 for a plain text field). This will allow multiple users to edit the text concurrently with ShareDB ensuring consistency.
	‚Ä¢	Monorepo with Turborepo: The project is organized as a monorepo to encapsulate the frontend and backend as separate packages (and possibly a third "shared" package for common code). We use Turborepo to manage builds and running tasks across packages. This will allow running both the server and client with one command and ensure consistent tooling. A typical layout will be:
	‚Ä¢	apps/client: React frontend (TanStack Start app)
	‚Ä¢	apps/server: Express backend
	‚Ä¢	packages/shared: Shared TypeScript types and schemas (document schemas, API schemas, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	plus configuration files (package.json workspaces, turbo.json, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Package Manager: We use pnpm (a performant workspace-compatible package manager) for installing dependencies across the monorepo (consistent with best practices in prior projects) Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD and Tooling: The project will include configuration for GitHub Actions to run on each push/PR. CI steps will install dependencies, lint, run tests, check formatting, and report coverage. We will also automate OpenAPI schema generation from the TypeBox schemas (explained below) so that the REST API (if any) is documented and the schemas remain the single source of truth. No deployment step is included in CI. Code quality tools include ESLint (for linting), Prettier (code formatting), and possibly Husky or a lint-staged config for pre-commit hooks (to catch issues before commits). We aim to maintain a high test coverage (e.g. > 80%) throughout development Ôøº.

With the tech stack defined, the agent will proceed to implement the system in logical phases, ensuring that at each phase the system is in a runnable, testable state.

Phase 1: Monorepo Setup (Project Foundation)

Goal: Establish the foundational repository structure and workspace configuration so that frontend and backend can be developed in parallel. The agent will create the monorepo and scaffold minimal "Hello World" applications for client and server, verifying that both can be started and tested. This phase forms the foundation of the project Ôøº.

Tasks in Phase 1:
	‚Ä¢	1.1 Initialize Version Control: The agent starts by setting up a new Git repository for the project. It may create an initial README and a .gitignore (with Node, React, and general artifacts) and make an initial commit like "chore: initial repository setup".
	‚Ä¢	1.2 Monorepo Directory Structure: Create the directory layout for Turborepo. This includes a root package.json that defines a workspace. For example, in the root package.json:

{
  "name": "collab-edit-demo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ]
}

And create subdirectories:
	‚Ä¢	apps/client/ ‚Äì for the React TanStack Start app.
	‚Ä¢	apps/server/ ‚Äì for the Node/Express app.
	‚Ä¢	packages/shared/ ‚Äì for shared code (schemas, types, utilities).
Also add a pnpm-workspace.yaml (or equivalent) listing these directories if using pnpm.

	‚Ä¢	1.3 Turborepo Configuration: Add a turbo.json config at the root to define the monorepo task pipeline. For instance:

{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "dependsOn": ["^dev"],
      "parallel": true
    },
    "lint": {},
    "test": {}
  }
}

This configuration means:
	‚Ä¢	Running turbo run build will build all packages (with each depending on its dependencies' build).
	‚Ä¢	turbo run dev will run dev servers in parallel for client and server (not cached).
	‚Ä¢	We also define pipelines for lint and test so they can be run across all packages. The agent will ensure that each sub-project has appropriate npm scripts (like "build", "dev", "lint", "test") which Turborepo can invoke.

	‚Ä¢	1.4 Base Client Setup: Scaffold a minimal React app in apps/client using TanStack Start. The agent can either use a quick-start example from TanStack or set up from scratch:
	‚Ä¢	Initialize a new Node project in apps/client (npm init -y or similar via pnpm).
	‚Ä¢	Add dependencies: React, ReactDOM, TanStack Router/Start, and any build tool (TanStack Start might come with its own build setup, possibly using Vite or ESBuild).
	‚Ä¢	Create an index.tsx and App component. For now, a simple "Hello from Collaborative Editor" message can suffice to test rendering.
	‚Ä¢	If TanStack Start supports server functions or SSR, decide if we enable them. For simplicity, initially the app can be run in development mode as a client-side app (with something like Vite's dev server). We ensure the routing works by defining a simple route (e.g. root "/" showing a welcome page).
	‚Ä¢	The agent will also configure a dev script in apps/client/package.json (e.g. using Vite or a Next.js-like dev server if TanStack Start provides one). For example: "dev": "tanstack start dev" or a custom script if needed.
	‚Ä¢	1.5 Base Server Setup: Scaffold a minimal Express server in apps/server:
	‚Ä¢	Initialize apps/server with its own package.json and add dependencies: express, ws (for WebSocket), ShareDB, @teamwork/websocket-json-stream (for ShareDB+WS integration), and TypeScript-related dev deps (ts-node or a build step).
	‚Ä¢	Create a simple Express server file (e.g. server.ts) that starts an HTTP server on a given port (say 3001). Add a basic route, e.g. GET /health returning a JSON like { status: "ok" } to verify the server runs.
	‚Ä¢	At this stage, not yet integrating ShareDB (that comes in a later phase), but include the ws library and set up an HTTP server from the Express app:

import express from 'express';
import http from 'http';
const app = express();
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => res.json({ status: 'ok' }));
const server = http.createServer(app);
// (We will attach ShareDB to this server in Phase 3)
server.listen(3001, () => console.log('Server listening on 3001'));


	‚Ä¢	Add a dev script for the server (e.g. using ts-node-dev or nodemon to auto-restart on changes). For example: "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn server.ts".
	‚Ä¢	The server's port (3001) should be different from the client's (3000) to avoid conflicts; later we might proxy the dev server or configure CORS as needed.

	‚Ä¢	1.6 TypeScript Configuration: Set up TypeScript in both client and server:
	‚Ä¢	Create tsconfig.json in each, extending from a base config in the root if desired. E.g., in root tsconfig.base.json define common compiler options (target ESNext, module commonjs/ESM as needed, strict true, etc.). Then each package's tsconfig extends it and sets appropriate include paths.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure types are resolved properly (especially for the shared package when we create it). The packages/shared will also have a tsconfig.
	‚Ä¢	1.7 Verify Development Startup: At this point, the agent will test that the basic apps run:
	‚Ä¢	Run pnpm install at the root to install all dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Start the backend: pnpm turbo run dev --filter=apps/server (or simply pnpm --filter apps/server dev). The Express server should start and log "Server listening on 3001". The agent can hit the /health endpoint (e.g. via a fetch or curl in Node) to ensure it returns {"status":"ok"}.
	‚Ä¢	Start the frontend: pnpm turbo run dev --filter=apps/client. This should start the React dev server (likely on http://localhost:3000). The agent can make a simple HTTP request to localhost:3000 or examine the console to ensure the dev server compiled the app successfully. Since it's a UI, full verification might be manual, but the presence of no errors in the console and the known "Hello" text being served is a good sign. (If automated verification is needed, the agent could use something like Puppeteer to load the page and check for the text, but that's probably overkill for now.)
	‚Ä¢	The agent ensures that running both dev servers simultaneously is possible. We may create a root-level script "dev" to run both in parallel. For example, in root package.json:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel"
}

Then pnpm run dev will start both client and server concurrently (Turborepo will show logs from both, possibly in a combined or TUI view).

	‚Ä¢	1.8 Initial Testing: Write a very basic test to ensure the scaffold works:
	‚Ä¢	For the server, the agent can add a test (using Jest or Mocha) to call the health endpoint. For example, using supertest:

import request from 'supertest';
import app from './server';  // assuming app is exported
test('GET /health returns ok', async () => {
  const res = await request(app).get('/health');
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  expect(res.body.status).toBe('ok');
});

This verifies the Express app responds as expected.

	‚Ä¢	For the client, perhaps set up Jest with React Testing Library to render the main App component and assert it contains the welcome text.
	‚Ä¢	These tests ensure that the basic setup is sound. The agent runs pnpm turbo run test to execute tests in all packages. Initially we expect a couple of trivial tests to pass.

	‚Ä¢	1.9 Commit Phase 1: After verifying all the above, the agent commits the changes (e.g., "feat: initial monorepo structure with base client & server"). This commit includes the workspace config, turbo config, minimal client and server code, and the passing tests.

At the end of Phase 1, we have a skeleton monorepo: both an Express API server and a React app can run and are organized under Turborepo. We have verified that the dev environment can be spun up and that basic tests pass, establishing a solid foundation.

Phase 2: Shared Schema Definitions and Validation (Domain Modeling)

Goal: Define the data models and API schemas for the application in a single place, and set up validation logic. Using TypeBox, we will create JSON Schema definitions for our collaborative document data and any API endpoints. These schemas will be reused on both backend and frontend to ensure consistency and end-to-end type safety Ôøº. We'll also configure Ajv for runtime validation and prepare to generate an OpenAPI spec from these schemas.

Tasks in Phase 2:
	‚Ä¢	2.1 Establish Shared Module: In packages/shared, create modules for types and schemas. For example, a file packages/shared/src/schemas.ts will use TypeBox to build JSON Schemas for our domain:
	‚Ä¢	Document Schema: Define what a "document" looks like. For a simple text editing demo, a document might have an ID, a title, and content. Using TypeBox:

import { Type, Static } from '@sinclair/typebox';
export const DocumentSchema = Type.Object({
  id: Type.String({ format: 'uuid' }),           // unique doc identifier
  title: Type.String({ maxLength: 100 }),        // title of document
  content: Type.String()                         // the content (could be plain text for now)
});
export type Document = Static<typeof DocumentSchema>;

This creates a JSON Schema object (DocumentSchema) and a TypeScript type Document inferred from it. The agent ensures any constraints (like maxLength or format) are captured in the schema.

	‚Ä¢	API Request/Response Schemas: If we plan to have REST API endpoints (for example, to create a new document or list documents), define those schemas as well. For instance, a schema for a CreateDocument request might include only a title (and maybe initial content):

export const CreateDocRequestSchema = Type.Object({
  title: Type.String({ maxLength: 100 }),
  content: Type.Optional(Type.String())
});
export type CreateDocRequest = Static<typeof CreateDocRequestSchema>;

And a response schema could be the full Document or an ID reference.

	‚Ä¢	ShareDB OT Type Config: If using a specific OT type like text0 for content, we might not need a full JSON schema for operations (ShareDB handles OT). However, we might define a schema for any additional messages (e.g., a presence or cursor update, if we extended collaboration features).
	‚Ä¢	Validation logic: Add a utility in packages/shared to compile these schemas using Ajv. For example, create an Ajv instance and compile validators:

import Ajv from 'ajv';
import addFormats from 'ajv-formats';
import { DocumentSchema, CreateDocRequestSchema } from './schemas';
const ajv = new Ajv({ allErrors: true });
addFormats(ajv); // support formats like "uuid" in schemas
export const validateDocument = ajv.compile(DocumentSchema);
export const validateCreateDoc = ajv.compile(CreateDocRequestSchema);

This leverages Ajv to produce efficient validation functions for the schemas Ôøº. Using Ajv with TypeBox is necessary because TypeBox's focus is on schema definition; it relies on an external validator like Ajv to actually check data Ôøº Ôøº. With the above, validateDocument(data) will return true or false depending on whether data matches the DocumentSchema, and validateDocument.errors will hold any validation errors.

	‚Ä¢	2.2 Integrate Shared Types in Frontend and Backend: Now that we have a Document type and schemas, the agent will ensure both the server and client can import these. In each of apps/client and apps/server, add a dependency on the shared package (e.g. by referencing it in their package.json). Since it's a workspace, packages/shared will be built/linked in.
	‚Ä¢	On the backend, these schemas will be used to validate input and output of API routes (and possibly initial document content in ShareDB).
	‚Ä¢	On the frontend, these types allow us to strongly type the data we handle. For example, when the client receives a document via an API or WebSocket, it can treat it as type Document for reliability.
	‚Ä¢	2.3 OpenAPI Specification Generation: With JSON Schemas available for all endpoints and models, we can set up generation of an OpenAPI spec:
	‚Ä¢	Create an OpenAPI template (YAML or JSON file) that includes basic info (title, version, etc.). The agent might place this in packages/shared or a separate docs/ folder.
	‚Ä¢	Use the fact that OpenAPI 3.1 fully supports JSON Schema Ôøº. We can programmatically insert our TypeBox schemas into the OpenAPI definitions. For example, define the components section of OpenAPI to reference the schema output of DocumentSchema:

// Pseudocode:
const openApiSpec = {
  openapi: "3.1.0",
  info: { title: "Collaborative Edit API", version: "1.0.0" },
  paths: {
    "/documents": {
      post: {
        summary: "Create a new document",
        requestBody: {
          content: {
            "application/json": { schema: CreateDocRequestSchema }  // JSON Schema inserted
          }
        },
        responses: {
          "201": {
            description: "Document created",
            content: { "application/json": { schema: DocumentSchema } }
          }
        }
      },
      get: {
        summary: "List all documents",
        responses: {
          "200": {
            description: "Array of documents",
            content: { "application/json": { schema: Type.Array(DocumentSchema) } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

TypeBox schemas are JavaScript objects (with type, properties, etc.), so they can be directly embedded in the OpenAPI JSON. This is a big advantage of TypeBox: it aligns with JSON Schema and thus with OpenAPI definitions Ôøº. (By contrast, libraries like Zod would require conversion to JSON Schema since they are not JSON Schema-based.)

	‚Ä¢	The agent will implement a script (maybe in packages/shared or a new scripts/ directory) to output the OpenAPI spec. For instance, a Node script that imports the schemas and writes openapi.json. We'll also include a check in CI to verify the spec is up-to-date (comparing the file with what the script generates).
	‚Ä¢	Additionally, we may use a library or Ajv to validate the OpenAPI spec itself (ensuring it's a valid OpenAPI document). This is a sanity check in CI.

	‚Ä¢	2.4 Unit Tests for Schemas: Add tests to ensure the validation works as expected. For example, in packages/shared, write tests for validateCreateDoc:
	‚Ä¢	Test that a valid object (e.g. { title: "Test Doc" }) passes validation.
	‚Ä¢	Test that an invalid object (e.g. { title: "" } or too long a title) fails and that validateCreateDoc.errors contains the expected error message.
These tests help catch any mistakes in our schema definitions early.
	‚Ä¢	2.5 Commit Phase 2: Commit the new shared code and any modifications to client/server to integrate it (e.g., "feat: add TypeBox schemas for Document and API, with Ajv validation"). Now the codebase has a single source of truth for data structures, and both front and back are aware of them.

At the end of Phase 2, we have robust schema definitions for our data model and API. The project can now ensure any data interchange (whether via REST or WebSocket) conforms to these schemas. We are also prepared to generate API documentation easily from the code, a practice advocated in similar projects where JSON Schema and OpenAPI are needed for strict input/output definitions Ôøº.

Phase 3: Backend Implementation (Express API & ShareDB Real-Time Server)

Goal: Build out the backend application by implementing the Express server functionality and integrating ShareDB for real-time collaboration. The backend will serve both standard HTTP endpoints (e.g. to create or list documents) and the WebSocket endpoint for ShareDB. At the end of this phase, the backend should support all needed operations for the collaborative editor and pass its tests.

Tasks in Phase 3:
	‚Ä¢	3.1 Express Server Routes: Using the schemas from Phase 2, implement RESTful API routes (if needed) in Express:
	‚Ä¢	Create Document (POST /documents): Add a route to create a new document. For example:

app.post('/documents', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const body = req.body;
  if (!validateCreateDoc(body)) {  // Ajv validation
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid input", details: validateCreateDoc.errors });
  }
  // Create the document in ShareDB or DB:
  const { title, content = "" } = body;
  const newDocId = uuid();  // generate a unique id for the doc
  // Use ShareDB backend to create the document:
  const connection = shareDBBackend.connect();
  const doc = connection.get('documents', newDocId);
  doc.create({ title, content }, (err) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to create document" });
    // Respond with the created document data (id, title, content)
    res.status(201).json({ id: newDocId, title, content });
  });
});

Here we validate the request body using validateCreateDoc (from our Ajv compiled schemas). If valid, we proceed to create a new ShareDB document. We assume a ShareDB collection named "documents" for storing docs, and use ShareDB's doc.create() to initialize the content Ôøº. We then return the created document. (In a more advanced setup, we might also initialize some metadata in Mongo directly, but since ShareDB will persist it, this is enough.)

	‚Ä¢	List Documents (GET /documents): We can implement a route to list existing documents. This could query MongoDB directly for all docs in the "documents" collection. ShareDB's Mongo adapter stores each document as a Mongo document in the documents collection plus an ops log Ôøº. For simplicity, we might not implement complex queries in this demo ‚Äì perhaps we maintain a separate collection or in-memory list of docs for demo purposes. Alternatively, skip this route in the demo and focus on real-time.
	‚Ä¢	Get Document (GET /documents/:id): Optionally, an endpoint to fetch a single document's data. This could simply return the document content if needed (though in real-time scenario, clients typically use the ShareDB connection to get the document, not a REST fetch).
	‚Ä¢	Middleware & Config: Add any needed middleware: e.g., enable CORS on the Express app (so the frontend running on a different port can call the APIs), and serve static files if needed (maybe not relevant since dev server serves frontend).
	‚Ä¢	Use TypeBox Schemas for Responses: We ensure that responses we send conform to our schemas. For instance, in the create document route, we send back an object matching DocumentSchema. This is naturally true if we use the validated input and our own ID, but it's a good practice to double-check or even validate the response in tests.

	‚Ä¢	3.2 Integrate ShareDB (WebSocket OT Server): The core of collaboration is setting up ShareDB on the backend:
	‚Ä¢	Initialize ShareDB Backend: In the server startup code (server.ts), instantiate the ShareDB backend and connect it to MongoDB. We use the sharedb-mongo adapter:

import ShareDB from 'sharedb';
import ShareDBMongo from 'sharedb-mongo';
const mongoUrl = process.env.MONGO_URL || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/collab_demo';
const shareDBBackend = new ShareDB({ db: ShareDBMongo(mongoUrl) });

This configures ShareDB to use a Mongo database (database name "collab_demo" in this example) for persistence. The adapter will store document snapshots and ops in Mongo Ôøº. The agent will ensure a Mongo instance is running locally for development (the plan could include instructions for the developer to start MongoDB, or the agent might use Docker to run one).

	‚Ä¢	Attach ShareDB to WebSocket: Create a WebSocket server that routes connections to ShareDB:

import { Server as WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import WebSocketJSONStream from '@teamwork/websocket-json-stream';
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server });  // `server` is our Node http server
wss.on('connection', (socket) => {
  const stream = new WebSocketJSONStream(socket);
  shareDBBackend.listen(stream);
});

This code means any incoming WebSocket connection to our server will be passed to ShareDB as a stream Ôøº. The ShareDB backend listens on that stream, performing OT synchronization. By default, this accepts connections on the same port as the Express server (e.g. ws://localhost:3001).
We might restrict this to a specific path if desired (for example, only accept WS upgrade requests on a certain URL), but for a demo it's fine to accept all WS for ShareDB.

	‚Ä¢	Select OT Type for Documents: If we want to treat document content as text, we should use ShareDB's text OT type for that document. For instance, when creating a doc, we could specify doc.create(initialData, 'text0') if content is just a text string. Alternatively, since we structured a document as an object {title, content}, the default type json0 can handle it (it will treat the object as JSON and allow changing the content property via OT operations). To keep it simple, we can rely on json0 and just ensure all edits happen on the content field of the JSON document.
	‚Ä¢	Security/Validation: By default, ShareDB will allow any ops on the document. We might want to add ShareDB middleware for validation or access control ‚Äì for instance, to prevent editing of fields other than content. Given this is a demo and time is limited, we might skip deep ShareDB validation. However, a simple measure: use the schema to validate the initial document data on creation (as we did in the create route). For ops, trust ShareDB to handle OT consistency.

	‚Ä¢	3.3 Backend Testing: Now the agent writes tests to ensure the backend logic is correct:
	‚Ä¢	API Route Tests: Using supertest or a similar approach, test the /documents POST route:
	‚Ä¢	Send an invalid payload ({ title: "" }) and expect a 400 response.
	‚Ä¢	Send a valid payload ({ title: "Test", content: "Hello" }) and expect a 201 with a JSON matching our DocumentSchema (the response should include an id and echo the title/content).
	‚Ä¢	After creation, optionally GET the document or list documents to ensure it was stored (though listing might not be fully implemented without extra query logic).
	‚Ä¢	ShareDB Integration Test: Testing real-time behavior in an automated way is tricky, but we can do a basic simulation:
	‚Ä¢	Use the ShareDB client library in the test to connect to the WebSocket server (perhaps using Node's WebSocket). For example, create a WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:3001 and then:

const Connection = require('sharedb/lib/client').Connection;
const socket = new ReconnectingWebSocket('ws://localhost:3001');
const connection = new Connection(socket);
const doc = connection.get('documents', newlyCreatedDocId);
doc.subscribe(err => {
  // assert no error and doc.data matches what was created
  expect(doc.data.content).toBe("Hello");
  // then submit an operation and verify it:
  doc.submitOp([{ p: ['content', 0], si: 'H' }]);  // example: insert 'H' at beginning
});

And set up a listener on doc.on('op', ...) to verify that the operation is applied. This essentially tests that we can connect and modify the document Ôøº Ôøº. However, this might be too involved for an initial automated test. We might instead do a simpler test: call the create route, then directly use the MongoDB to verify the document is stored (checking the Mongo collection for the doc ID).

	‚Ä¢	Ensure to close connections after test.

	‚Ä¢	Test Setup/Teardown: For any tests hitting Mongo or WebSocket, use a test database (e.g. "collab_demo_test") and clean it up before/after. The agent can set an environment variable in the test environment for MONGO_URL to use a separate DB.
	‚Ä¢	Aim for high coverage on backend logic (at least all API route branches).

	‚Ä¢	3.4 Documentation & Logging: Update project documentation (e.g., in a README or docs folder) to record how to run the backend and what endpoints exist. Also, implement basic logging in the server. For example, use a logger like Pino instead of console.log for structured logging (this was a standard in prior projects Ôøº). For now, a simple console log on server startup and error cases is acceptable.
	‚Ä¢	3.5 Commit Phase 3: Commit the completed backend code (e.g., "feat: implement backend API and real-time server"). At this stage, the backend server can create documents (via HTTP) and supports collaborative editing on those documents via WebSocket. All backend tests should be passing. The local MongoDB contains the document data and ShareDB's op log, verifying persistence.

By the end of Phase 3, the backend is essentially feature-complete: it exposes an API for basic document management and a WebSocket interface for real-time editing. We leveraged TypeBox and Ajv to enforce that the data conforms to the expected shapes (both incoming and outgoing) Ôøº. The ShareDB integration allows multiple clients to work on the same document simultaneously, with MongoDB ensuring changes are durable. The backend is ready to support the frontend we build next.

Phase 4: Frontend Implementation (React Client with TanStack & XState)

Goal: Develop the React frontend application that allows users to create or select a document and edit it collaboratively. We will use TanStack Start for the project structure and routing, and manage the editor's state with an XState state machine. The frontend will communicate with the backend via the REST API (for initial document creation/listing) and via ShareDB's WebSocket for live updates. By the end of this phase, a user should be able to open the app, create a new document, and see an editing interface that updates in real-time (multiple instances of the app would show synchronized content).

Tasks in Phase 4:
	‚Ä¢	4.1 Frontend Project Setup (TanStack Start): If not fully completed in Phase 1, finalize the TanStack Start configuration:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the React app is configured to use TanStack Router. Create a basic router setup with at least two routes: e.g., / for a home or document list page, and /doc/:id for the document editor page.
	‚Ä¢	TanStack Start typically has its own file structure (pages, routes definitions, etc.). The agent will follow best practices from TanStack's docs to configure this. For example, define route components and use <RouterProvider> to initialize.
	‚Ä¢	If TanStack Start supports server-side rendering, we might leave that for future and run the app in client mode for now (to keep debugging simpler). The crucial part is that routing and navigation work.
	‚Ä¢	4.2 UI Layout and Components: Implement the necessary components:
	‚Ä¢	Home/Document List Page: A simple page that either lists existing documents or provides a form to create a new document. We can call the backend API (GET /documents) to list docs and POST /documents to create one. Use fetch or a utility (TanStack Query could be used here for data fetching, though not strictly required). On successfully creating a document, navigate to /doc/{id}.
	‚Ä¢	Editor Page (/doc/:id): This page is the collaborative editor. Key elements:
	‚Ä¢	A text area or a rich text editor component to display and edit the document's content.
	‚Ä¢	Possibly a title display/edit field (if we allow editing the title collaboratively as well).
	‚Ä¢	Perhaps a list of connected users or some indicator of collaboration (could be a stretch goal, using ShareDB's presence if available).
	‚Ä¢	A "status" indicator (like "Connecting‚Ä¶", "Connected" or error messages) which will be driven by our state machine.
	‚Ä¢	Style is not the focus, but we can include basic styling for usability.
	‚Ä¢	4.3 State Management with XState: Use XState to manage the complex states of the editor:
	‚Ä¢	Define a machine that represents the lifecycle of a collaborative editing session. For example:

import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';
interface Context { docId: string; error?: string; }
type Events =
  | { type: 'CONNECT'; docId: string }
  | { type: 'CONNECTED' }
  | { type: 'LOAD_SUCCESS'; data: Document }
  | { type: 'LOAD_ERROR'; message: string }
  | { type: 'UPDATE_LOCAL'; content: string }
  | { type: 'REMOTE_OP'; content: string }
  | { type: 'DISCONNECT' };
const editorMachine = createMachine<Context, Events>({
  id: 'editor',
  initial: 'idle',
  context: { docId: '' },
  states: {
    idle: {
      on: { CONNECT: { target: 'connecting', actions: 'setDocId' } }
    },
    connecting: {
      invoke: {
        src: 'openConnection',  // action to open WebSocket and ShareDB connection
        onDone: { target: 'loading' },    // connection opened
        onError: { target: 'error', actions: 'setError' }
      }
    },
    loading: {
      invoke: {
        src: 'loadDocument',   // action to subscribe to doc
        onDone: { target: 'editing', actions: 'setInitialData' },
        onError: { target: 'error', actions: 'setError' }
      }
    },
    editing: {
      on: {
        UPDATE_LOCAL: { actions: 'submitLocalChange' },  // user typed something
        REMOTE_OP:   { actions: 'applyRemoteChange' },   // incoming op from server
        DISCONNECT:  { target: 'idle', actions: 'cleanupConnection' }
      }
    },
    error: {
      on: {
        CONNECT: { target: 'connecting', actions: 'setDocId' }  // allow retry
      }
    }
  }
}, {
  actions: {
    setDocId: assign((ctx, event) => event.type === 'CONNECT' ? { docId: event.docId } : {}),
    setInitialData: assign((ctx, event) => {
      if (event.type === 'done.invoke.loadDocument') {
        return {}; // state machine context could store doc data if needed
      }
      return {};
    }),
    setError: assign((ctx, event) => 'message' in event ? { error: event.message } : {}),
    // submitLocalChange and applyRemoteChange would be implemented to interface with ShareDB client
  }
});

The above is an illustrative schema for the machine. It has states for when the client is connecting to the server, loading the document data, actively editing, or encountering an error. The machine invokes services (like openConnection and loadDocument) which are functions that handle the asynchronous work of connecting to the WebSocket and subscribing to the ShareDB document. On success, they trigger events that transition the state. XState helps formalize these transitions instead of handling them ad-hoc via many useEffect hooks.

	‚Ä¢	Integrate XState with React: Use XState's React hooks (useMachine) to run the state machine in our Editor component. For example:

import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
const [state, send] = useMachine(editorMachine, { devTools: true });  // devTools for debugging
useEffect(() => {
  // On mount, send CONNECT to begin connecting:
  send({ type: 'CONNECT', docId: docIdFromRoute });
}, [docIdFromRoute]);
// state.matches('editing') can be used to conditionally render the editor UI, etc.

The component can render different content based on the state:
	‚Ä¢	If state.matches('connecting') or 'loading': show a "Connecting‚Ä¶" or "Loading document‚Ä¶" message or spinner.
	‚Ä¢	If in 'error': show an error message with a retry option.
	‚Ä¢	If in 'editing': show the text editor input.

	‚Ä¢	Handling Collaboration Events: When the user types in the text area, we handle it via the machine:
	‚Ä¢	On text input change, call send({ type: 'UPDATE_LOCAL', content: newText }). The machine's submitLocalChange action will call doc.submitOp() on the ShareDB client doc to send the delta to the server. For a plain text field, the delta could be represented as an OT operation (like insert or delete). However, to simplify, we might choose to always send the full text as a JSON replacement operation (not efficient, but okay for demo). Alternatively, incorporate Quill.js to get delta ops and use ShareDB's rich-text OT type ‚Äì but that's an enhancement.
	‚Ä¢	When a remote operation comes in (ShareDB doc.on('op') event), we call send({ type: 'REMOTE_OP', content: doc.data.content }) to update the local state with the new content. The machine's applyRemoteChange action will update a piece of React state (or context) that holds the current content.
	‚Ä¢	We can store the document content in React local state or in the XState context. For simplicity, we might use a useState for the content bound to the textarea, and update it in both UPDATE_LOCAL (when user types, optimistic update) and REMOTE_OP (when others' changes arrive) actions.
	‚Ä¢	Cleanup: On component unmount or when user navigates away, we send DISCONNECT to close the ShareDB connection (unsubscribe from doc, close WebSocket).
	‚Ä¢	By using XState, we ensure that the UI properly reflects connection status and transitions (e.g., we don't start editing until the doc is loaded, errors don't let you type, etc.), making the collaborative experience more robust.

	‚Ä¢	4.4 Connect to Backend APIs: In the Home page, use fetch (or TanStack Query) to get document list and to create documents:
	‚Ä¢	Example for creating a doc:

async function createDocument(title) {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/documents', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ title })
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create');
  return await res.json();  // returns Document object
}

On form submit, call createDocument, then navigate to /doc/{id} using TanStack Router's navigation.

	‚Ä¢	In production, we'd store the API URL in a config and handle errors properly, but for the demo simplicity and local dev, this is fine.
	‚Ä¢	For retrieving the list of documents (if implemented), do a GET and display them as links.

	‚Ä¢	4.5 Frontend Testing: Write tests for critical frontend logic:
	‚Ä¢	State Machine Unit Test: Using XState's testing utilities or by simulating events, test that the editor state machine transitions correctly. For example, if we send CONNECT, it should go to connecting state; if the connection fails, it transitions to error; if succeeds and doc loads, it ends up in editing state.
	‚Ä¢	Component Tests: Use React Testing Library to test components:
	‚Ä¢	Test that the Home page render includes a form or button to create a doc.
	‚Ä¢	Mock the fetch call for createDocument to simulate a successful creation and ensure that after calling, navigation happens (this might require mocking TanStack Router navigation).
	‚Ä¢	Test the Editor component with a mocked ShareDB connection: This is challenging to do fully, but we can abstract the ShareDB client in a hook or service that we mock in tests. For instance, create a custom hook useShareDB(docId) that returns the current content and a function to make changes, and internally handles the connection. In tests, replace it with a fake that immediately "loads" content. Then we can assert that initial content is displayed and that typing calls the appropriate function.
	‚Ä¢	At least test that when the Editor mounts, it shows "Connecting‚Ä¶" then (with a mocked success) shows the editor area with content.
	‚Ä¢	Manual Testing: After running automated tests, the agent (or developer) should do a manual integration test: open two browser windows pointing to the app (http://localhost:3000). Create a document from one window, copy the URL for the doc, open it in the second window, then type in one and see the text update in the other. This will confirm the end-to-end collaboration works as expected.
	‚Ä¢	4.6 Commit Phase 4: Commit the completed frontend (e.g., "feat: add collaborative editor frontend with XState state machine"). Now the application end-to-end is usable for collaborative text editing. Both the server and client honor the shared schema (ensuring, for example, that the server never sends a malformed document and the client knows the exact structure of data to expect).

At the end of Phase 4, the demo application is functionally complete: an arbitrary number of clients can collaborate on document content in real-time. The frontend provides an interface and leverages XState for robust state handling, while the backend ensures consistency via ShareDB and data integrity via schema validation. This phased build-out aligns with best practices of incremental development, as seen in other projects ‚Äì build the foundation, then each component, and integrate ‚Äì ensuring each step is tested and working before moving on Ôøº.

Phase 5: CI/CD and Automation

Goal: Ensure the project maintains high code quality and that all aspects (linting, formatting, tests, and documentation) are automatically checked. We set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration, enforcing that every commit/PR meets our standards. While deployment is out of scope, these CI steps will keep the project healthy for developers. We also finalize any remaining documentation (like the OpenAPI spec and README instructions).

Tasks in Phase 5:
	‚Ä¢	5.1 Linting and Formatting: Configure ESLint and Prettier:
	‚Ä¢	ESLint: Add an ESLint config (possibly separate for frontend and backend if needed, or one root config). Use recommended presets (eslint:recommended, plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended, etc.), and include rules for code style and catching problems. Include React-specific lint rules for the client and maybe Node rules for the server. Ensure the config extends to TypeScript files and that we run eslint --max-warnings 0 (no warnings allowed) in CI.
	‚Ä¢	Prettier: Add a Prettier config (or rely on defaults) and ensure ESLint either integrates with Prettier or at least that we run Prettier check. Typically, we can use eslint-plugin-prettier or simply run prettier --check . in CI.
	‚Ä¢	Package scripts: Add "lint": "eslint ." and "format": "prettier --write ." (for manual use) in the root or individual packages. We might have separate scripts per package, but a root script can invoke turborepo to run eslint in each or just run eslint across the whole repo (since it's configured for monorepo).
	‚Ä¢	5.2 Comprehensive Testing: Ensure that the test scripts run both unit and integration tests. We might separate "unit" vs "integration" tests with different commands. The CI will run all tests with coverage:
	‚Ä¢	Use Jest's --coverage flag or a separate coverage tool to generate a coverage report. The threshold can be set (e.g., fail if coverage < 80%). This enforces the test coverage requirement Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	If possible, integrate a coverage service (like Codecov or Coveralls) by uploading the coverage results in CI. This is optional but useful for a real project.
	‚Ä¢	5.3 GitHub Actions Workflow: Create a workflow YAML (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml) to run on pushes and PRs:
	‚Ä¢	Use an Ubuntu runner. Steps:
	1.	Checkout code ‚Äì use actions/checkout.
	2.	Setup Node.js ‚Äì e.g., actions/setup-node@v4 with a specific version (Node 18 or 20) and enable caching for pnpm Ôøº.
	3.	Setup pnpm ‚Äì use pnpm/action-setup@v2 to install pnpm on the runner Ôøº.
	4.	Install dependencies ‚Äì run pnpm install at the root Ôøº.
	5.	Setup services ‚Äì (If tests require MongoDB) use the services feature of GH Actions to start a Mongo service. For example:

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:5.0
    ports: [27017:27017]

This will spin up a MongoDB that our tests can connect to (using default URL). Our tests should be configured to use a test database name to avoid clashing with any dev data.

	6.	Run lint ‚Äì pnpm run lint. This should analyze all code and produce no errors.
	7.	Run type check ‚Äì pnpm run build or a dedicated tsc --noEmit to ensure TypeScript types are sound Ôøº.
	8.	Run tests ‚Äì pnpm run test -- --coverage. This runs all tests. We can have it produce an output like coverage summary which Actions can display.
	9.	OpenAPI validation ‚Äì (Optional) run a script to generate the OpenAPI spec and then use ajv validate-schema or an OpenAPI linter (like speccy or openapi-cli) to ensure it's valid. Also, we might compare the generated spec with the version in the repo to catch if someone forgot to update it when schemas changed.
	10.	Artifacts ‚Äì Optionally, upload the coverage report or OpenAPI spec as build artifacts for reference.
If all steps pass, the build is considered successful. We will not deploy, so no deploy step. The workflow ensures every push gets quick feedback.
Example snippet from our CI config:

- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install
- name: Run quality checks
  run: |
    pnpm lint
    pnpm type-check
    pnpm test

(This parallels prior projects' approach to run linting, type checking, and tests in CI Ôøº.)

	‚Ä¢	5.4 Git Hooks (Development Automation): Set up some local automation to assist developers:
	‚Ä¢	Using Husky, create a pre-commit hook to run pnpm lint and pnpm type-check. This prevents bad code from being committed in the first place.
	‚Ä¢	Possibly a commit-msg hook to enforce conventional commits format (if desired for project consistency).
	‚Ä¢	These are not strictly necessary, but help maintain quality.
	‚Ä¢	5.5 Documentation and Project README: Now that the app is complete, update or create documentation:
	‚Ä¢	README.md: Provide instructions on how to run the app (e.g., "start MongoDB, then run pnpm run dev to start both server and client, open localhost:3000"), how to run tests, and how the architecture is structured. Include any caveats or future improvements.
	‚Ä¢	OpenAPI Documentation: If not already done, publish the openapi.json (or .yaml) in a readable form. Perhaps mention you can use Swagger UI or similar to view it. This informs developers of the API available (e.g., the documents endpoints).
	‚Ä¢	Commenting and Code Docs: Ensure key parts of the code (especially in the shared schemas and the more complex client logic) have comments explaining the approach. This is important for future maintainers or if the project is handed off.
	‚Ä¢	Best Practices Noted: Document that the project followed best practices like end-to-end typing, high test coverage, proper logging (no console.log, we used structured logging) Ôøº, and consistent use of pnpm for all operations Ôøº. This will help new contributors uphold the same standards.
	‚Ä¢	5.6 Final Verification: The agent does a final full run:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure pnpm run build works (compiles frontend and backend for production build) ‚Äì this is a sanity check that the code is production-ready if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Run pnpm run dev to manually test the application again in the browser.
	‚Ä¢	Everything should be in a clean, reproducible state for others.
	‚Ä¢	5.7 Commit Phase 5: Commit the CI config, documentation, and any minor fixes made during this phase (e.g., "chore: add CI/CD workflow and documentation").

With Phase 5 complete, the project is not only working, but is maintainable and quality-checked. Every commit triggers automated checks for linting, formatting, test success, and schema correctness. This ensures the collaborative editing app remains robust as it evolves ‚Äì a lesson taken from previous projects where continuous validation was key Ôøº. We have effectively bootstrapped the application in a way that a team can confidently collaborate on its code just as end users collaborate on documents in the app!
