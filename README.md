# Collaborative Document Editing Demo

A real-time collaborative document editing application built with modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TanStack Start (routing) and XState (state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and ShareDB (Operational Transformation)
- **Database**: MongoDB for document persistence
- **Architecture**: TypeScript monorepo managed with Turborepo
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Features

- Real-time collaborative text editing
- Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously
- Automatic conflict resolution using Operational Transformation
- Document persistence with MongoDB
- Type-safe API with TypeBox schemas

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or v20)
- MongoDB (running locally)
- pnpm v9.15.5+ (install with `npm i -g pnpm`)

### Local Development Setup

#### Environment Configuration

- ✅ `.gitignore` comprehensively covers sensitive patterns (`.env`, secrets, credentials)
- ✅ TypeScript monorepo with strict type safety
- ✅ Turborepo for optimized build management

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd pub-sub-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Create .env files for each app (already in .gitignore)
   cp apps/client/.env.example apps/client/.env.local
   cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env.local
   ```

4. Start MongoDB:

   ```bash
   # Using brew:
   brew services start mongodb-community

   # Or with Docker:
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo:latest
   ```

#### Security Notes

- Never commit API keys or database credentials
- Use `.env.local` files for local development (in .gitignore)
- Review MongoDB connection strings for security
- Gemini CLI configuration follows secure practices (no secrets in config files)

### Development

#### Quick Commands (New!)

The project now includes a comprehensive Makefile for improved developer experience:

```bash
make help         # Show all available commands
make dev          # Start development environment
make test         # Run all tests safely
make quality      # Run quality checks (lint + type-check + test)
make setup        # Complete project setup
make docs         # Open documentation
```

#### Traditional Commands

Start the development servers:

```bash
make dev  # Recommended - includes Docker setup
# or
pnpm run dev
```

This will start:

- Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>
- Backend: <http://localhost:3001>

### Testing

The project follows a **user acceptance testing** approach [[memory:3829289]], focusing on critical workflows over code coverage:

```bash
make test                    # Run all tests safely
make test-integration        # Run integration tests
make test-user-workflows     # Run user workflow tests
make test-no-rate-limit      # Run tests without rate limiting
```

#### Test Organization

Tests are now organized in a structured directory:

```mermaid
test/
├── integration/             # API integration tests
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests (planned)
├── helpers/                # Test utilities
└── fixtures/               # Test data
```

## Project Structure

The project now follows DevX best practices with organized directories:
