# ShellCheck Baseline Report

This file previously tracked ShellCheck issues for shell scripts that have been converted to TypeScript.

## Converted Scripts:
- `.cursor/prompts/chains/run.sh` → `.cursor/prompts/chains/run.ts`
- `scripts/development/reset-database.sh` → `scripts/development/reset-database.ts`
- `scripts/setup-env.sh` → `scripts/setup-env.ts`
- `scripts/quality/lint-safe.sh` → `scripts/quality/lint-safe.ts`

All shell scripts with TypeScript equivalents have been removed.
