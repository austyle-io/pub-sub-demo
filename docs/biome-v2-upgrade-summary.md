# Biome v2 Upgrade Summary

## Overview

Successfully upgraded from Biome v1 to v2.0.0-beta.2 and maximized linting configuration. Removed ESLint setup entirely in favor of Biome's comprehensive rule set.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Maximization
- Created comprehensive Biome configuration with all available rules enabled
- Configured cognitive complexity limits (15 max)
- Set up naming conventions for functions, variables, types, and files
- Enabled security, performance, and accessibility rules

### 2. Biome v2 Upgrade
- Upgraded from Biome 2.1.2 to 2.0.0-beta.2
- Migrated configuration using `biome migrate` command
- Configuration now uses the v2 schema

### 3. GritQL Custom Rules
- Created custom GritQL rule files in `.biome/rules/`:
  - `no-react-fc.grit` - Prevents React.FC usage
  - `no-interface.grit` - Enforces type over interface
  - `no-switch-statements.grit` - Prevents switch statements
  - `boolean-naming.grit` - Enforces boolean naming conventions
  - `no-type-assertion.grit` - Prevents double type assertions
  - `component-size-limit.grit` - Warns about large components
  - `require-type-guards.grit` - Ensures proper type guards

**Note**: GritQL support in Biome v2 beta is experimental and the `search` command is available but custom rule enforcement is not yet integrated into the linting process.

### 4. ESLint Removal
- Removed all ESLint configurations and dependencies
- Deleted `.eslintrc.custom.json` and `eslint.config.custom.js`
- Removed ESLint-related npm scripts
- Updated turbo.json to remove ESLint references
- Cleaned up VS Code settings

## Current State

The project now uses Biome v2.0.0-beta.2 exclusively for:
- Code formatting
- Linting with comprehensive rule set
- Import organization
- Type checking assistance

## Key Rules Enforced by Biome

### Type Safety
- ✅ No explicit any
- ✅ No unused variables
- ✅ Exhaustive dependencies
- ✅ No type inference where explicit is better

### Code Style
- ✅ Use const over let/var
- ✅ Template literals over string concatenation
- ✅ Arrow functions preferred
- ✅ No useless else clauses
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions

### React Specific
- ✅ Hook rules (top level, dependencies)
- ✅ Fragment syntax
- ✅ Self-closing elements
- ✅ Accessibility rules

### Performance
- ✅ No accumulating spread
- ✅ Use optional chaining
- ✅ No delete operator

## Gaps and Limitations

Some cursor-specific rules cannot be enforced by Biome v2 beta:
1. React.FC detection (GritQL rule created but not enforced)
2. Interface prevention (covered by noEmptyInterface but not full ban)
3. Switch statement prevention (GritQL rule created but not enforced)
4. Branded type enforcement
5. Zod validation requirements

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Biome v2 Development**: Watch for stable release with full GritQL integration
2. **Manual Code Reviews**: Focus on cursor-specific patterns during reviews
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Consider simple grep-based checks for critical patterns
4. **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md updated with patterns to avoid
