# Biome v2.1.2 Comprehensive Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates Biome v2.1.2's functionality, including linting, formatting, custom GritQL rules, and pre-commit hook integration.

## Test Results

### 1. Built-in Rules (✅ Working)

Biome's built-in rules are functioning correctly and detecting violations:

**Detected Issues:**
- `noExplicitAny`: Caught uses of `any` type
- `noUnusedVariables`: Identified unused variables and functions
- `useConst`: Suggested const for non-reassigned variables
- `useTemplate`: Recommended template literals over string concatenation
- `noConsole`: Detected console.log statements
- `useExhaustiveDependencies`: Caught missing React hook dependencies
- `noArrayIndexKey`: Warned about array index as React key
- `noNonNullAssertion`: Detected non-null assertions
- `useArrowFunction`: Suggested arrow functions over function declarations
- And many more...

**Example Output:**
```
test-biome-rules.tsx:21:11 lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny
× Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```

### 2. Formatting (✅ Working)

Biome formatting is working correctly:

**Test Command:**
```bash
pnpm biome format test-biome-rules.tsx --write
```

**Result:**
- Successfully formatted 1 file in 2ms
- Applied consistent formatting according to configuration
- Respected settings: 2 spaces, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas

### 3. Custom GritQL Rules (❌ Not Working)

Despite creating valid GritQL rule files and adding them to the plugins array, custom rules are not being applied:

**Test Setup:**
- Created 8 custom rules in `.biome/rules/` directory
- Added rules to `plugins` array in `biome.json`
- Rules include: `no-react-fc.grit`, `no-interface.grit`, `no-switch-statements.grit`, etc.

**Result:**
- Custom rules are not triggering diagnostics
- Only built-in Biome rules are being applied
- No error messages about plugin loading failures

**Possible Reasons:**
1. GritQL plugin support may still be experimental/incomplete in v2.1.2
2. Additional configuration or flags may be required
3. Feature may not be fully implemented yet

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks (✅ Working)

Pre-commit integration is functioning correctly:

**Installation:**
```bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml):**
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/biomejs/pre-commit
  rev: v2.1.2
  hooks:
      - id: biome-check
        additional_dependencies: ["@biomejs/biome@2.1.2"]
```

**Test Results:**
- Pre-commit hooks successfully installed
- Biome check runs on staged files
- Integration with other hooks (detect-secrets, trailing-whitespace) works well
- Proper error reporting and fix suggestions

## Performance

Biome demonstrates excellent performance:
- File checking: Near-instant for individual files
- Formatting: 2ms for a 155-line test file
- Pre-commit: Minimal overhead added to commit process

## Configuration

Current working configuration (`biome.json`):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.1.2/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "correctness": {
        "useExhaustiveDependencies": "error",
        "useHookAtTopLevel": "error"
      },
      "style": {
        "useImportType": "error",
        "useNodejsImportProtocol": "error"
      },
      "suspicious": {
        "noExplicitAny": "error",
        "noArrayIndexKey": "error"
      }
    }
  },
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineWidth": 80
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use Biome for:**
   - Fast linting and formatting
   - Built-in rule enforcement
   - Pre-commit integration
   - TypeScript/JavaScript/JSX projects

2. **Current Limitations:**
   - Custom GritQL rules not functioning
   - Cannot extend cursor-specific rules via plugins yet
   - Some advanced ESLint rules have no equivalent

3. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Use Biome for standard rules and formatting
   - Keep ESLint for custom/complex rules if needed
   - Monitor Biome releases for GritQL plugin improvements

## Conclusion

Biome v2.1.2 is production-ready for standard linting and formatting needs. The tool offers excellent performance and good built-in rule coverage. However, the custom GritQL plugin functionality appears to be non-functional or requires additional configuration not documented clearly.

For projects requiring custom rules enforcement, a hybrid approach with ESLint may still be necessary until GritQL plugin support matures.
