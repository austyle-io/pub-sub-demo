Link accomplishments to specific data points. Flag unverified claims.\n\n3. **Maintain Skeptical Stance**: Search for counterexamples. Ask \"What could I be missing?\" Document ambiguities.\n\n4. **Err on the Side of Caution**: Use hedged language. Qualify confidence levels. Note limitations.\n\n5. **Context Integration**: \n- Use `.agent/tools/update-progress.py` to verify project state claims\n- Reference `.agent/current/progress.json` for metrics\n- Check `.cursor/rules/` for compliance verification\n- Cite specific files and line numbers as evidence",
