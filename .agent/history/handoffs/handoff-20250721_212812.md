# Handoff Report

**Project**: pub-sub-demo
**Date**: 2025-07-21
**Session**: 20250721_212812

## Session Summary

### What I Worked On

Successfully converted Winston audit logger to Pino. Main server console.log statements converted to structured logging. Winston dependency removed from codebase. Key files updated: audit-logger.ts (now uses Pino), database.ts (structured logging), permissions.ts (structured logging), server.ts (structured startup/error logging). Remaining console.log statements identified for future cleanup.

### What I Completed

- âœ… Agent system configuration setup
- âœ… Cursor rules and configuration adaptation

- Adopted comprehensive Cursor configuration from austdx project
- Implemented agent system for progress tracking and handoffs
- Established TypeScript best practices and security patterns

### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Monorepo with React frontend + Node.js backend
- **Real-time**: ShareDB for collaborative document editing
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright for comprehensive test coverage
- **Development**: pnpm workspaces with TypeScript strict mode

## Environment & Context

### Branch

- Current: `main`
- Base: `main`

### Key Commands Used

```bash
# Common commands from this session
make test
make lint
make dev
pnpm build
```

### Configuration Changes

- [x] Created .cursor.json configuration
- [x] Created .cursorrules file
- [x] Set up .agent/ directory structure
- [x] Added comprehensive TypeScript rules

## Collaborative Editing Context

### ShareDB/Real-time Features

- [ ] Enhanced permission checks implementation

## Handoff Instructions

For the next person working on this:

1. **Start here**: Review .agent/current/state.md for latest project status
2. **Watch out for**: TypeScript strict mode requires careful type handling
3. **Test with**: `make test` for comprehensive test suite
4. **Resources**:
   - .cursor/rules/ for coding standards
   - docs/ for project documentation
   - .agent/current/ for current state and blockers

## Session Metrics

- **Duration**: Development session
- **Files Modified**: 32
- **Overall Progress**: 85.0%
- **New Components**: Agent system integration
