## Important Notes

### Decisions Made

- Adopted comprehensive Cursor configuration from austdx project
- Implemented agent system for progress tracking and handoffs
- Established TypeScript best practices and security patterns

### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Monorepo with React frontend + Node.js backend
- **Real-time**: ShareDB for collaborative document editing
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright for comprehensive test coverage
- **Development**: pnpm workspaces with TypeScript strict mode

## Environment & Context

### Branch

- Current: `main`
- Base: `main`

### Key Commands Used

```bash
# Common commands from this session

## Handoff Instructions

For the next person working on this:

1. **Start here**: Review .agent/current/state.md for latest project status
2. **Watch out for**: TypeScript strict mode requires careful type handling
3. **Test with**: `make test` for comprehensive test suite
4. **Resources**:
   - .cursor/rules/ for coding standards
   - docs/ for project documentation
   - .agent/current/ for current state and blockers

## Session Metrics

- **Duration**: Development session
- **Files Modified**: 38
- **Overall Progress**: 86.1%
- **New Components**: Agent system integration
