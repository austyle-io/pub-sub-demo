# Agent System for Pub-Sub Demo

This directory contains the agent system for tracking progress, managing handoffs, and maintaining project state for the pub-sub-demo collaborative editing system.

## Overview

The agent system provides:
- **Progress Tracking**: Automated tracking of component completion percentages
- **Handoff Generation**: Structured handoff reports for development sessions
- **State Management**: Current project state and blocker tracking
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Make commands and development workflow

## Quick Start

### Check Current Progress
```bash
make up
# or
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py
```

### Generate Handoff Report
```bash
make ho "Completed user authentication, working on real-time sync"
# or
python3 .agent/tools/generate-handoff.py "Session notes here"
```

### Update Progress
```bash
# Update a specific component
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py update frontend document_editor 90

# Add a task
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py task "Implement cursor tracking" in_progress

# Update project phase
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py phase "production-ready"
```

## Tools Reference

### Progress Tracking Tool (`update-progress.py`)

**Purpose**: Track completion percentages for project components and manage tasks.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Display current progress
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py

# Update component progress (0-100)
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py update <category> <component> <value>

# Manage tasks
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py task <task_name> <status>
# Status: completed, in_progress, pending

# Update project phase
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py phase <phase_name>
```

**Examples**:
```bash
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py update frontend real_time_sync 95
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py task "Add presence indicators" completed
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py phase "production-ready"
```

### Handoff Generation Tool (`generate-handoff.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive handoff reports for development sessions.

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 .agent/tools/generate-handoff.py "Optional session notes"
```

**Features**:
- Automatically detects modified files from git
- Incorporates current progress and state
- Generates timestamped reports
- Updates latest handoff for quick access

## Project Components

The progress tracking system monitors these components:

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- `react_app` - Core application structure
- `authentication` - Login/logout and token management
- `document_editor` - Real-time document editing interface
- `real_time_sync` - ShareDB integration and synchronization
- `ui_components` - Reusable UI components and styling

### Backend (Node.js + ShareDB + TypeScript)
- `sharedb_integration` - ShareDB server and document management
- `jwt_auth` - JWT authentication and authorization
- `websocket_handling` - WebSocket connections and message routing
- `api_routes` - HTTP API endpoints and middleware
- `middleware` - Security, logging, and request processing

### Shared Package
- `type_definitions` - TypeScript types and interfaces
- `validation_schemas` - Zod schemas for data validation
- `auth_utilities` - Shared authentication helpers
- `logging` - Structured logging utilities

### Infrastructure
- `testing_setup` - Vitest, Playwright, and test configurations
- `ci_cd_pipeline` - GitHub Actions and deployment automation
- `docker_config` - Docker containers and orchestration
- `documentation` - Project documentation and guides

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start Session**: `make up` - Check current state
2. **During Development**: Edit `.agent/current/blockers.md` for issues
3. **End Session**: `make ho "What I accomplished"` - Generate handoff

### Make Commands Integration
```bash
make up    # Check progress (alias for python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py)
make ho    # Generate handoff (alias for python3 .agent/tools/generate-handoff.py)
```

### Cursor Integration
- Agent state files are referenced in `.cursor/modes.json`
- Progress and state inform AI assistant context
- Automated workflow supports development handoffs

## State Management

### Progress File (`current/progress.json`)
JSON format tracking:
- Component completion percentages by category
- Overall completion calculation
- Project metadata and health status
- Task lists by status (completed/in_progress/pending)

### State File (`current/state.md`)
Markdown format containing:
- Current project phase and objectives
- Recent achievements and active work
- Technical context and architecture notes
- Monitoring and quality metrics

### Blockers File (`current/blockers.md`)
Markdown format for:
- Active blockers with impact assessment
- Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- Resolved blockers with solutions
- Implementation notes and context

## Collaborative Editing Context

This agent system is specifically tailored for collaborative editing development:

### Real-time Features
- ShareDB operational transformation tracking
- WebSocket connection health monitoring
- Document synchronization performance metrics
- Multi-user collaboration testing status

### Security & Authentication
- JWT token validation implementation status
- Input sanitization and validation progress
- Permission system development tracking
- Security audit and hardening completion

### Performance Optimization
- ShareDB query optimization progress
- WebSocket efficiency improvements
- Document loading and sync speed enhancements
- Concurrent user capacity testing

## Best Practices

### When to Update Progress
- After completing major features or components
- When fixing significant bugs or issues
- After successful deployment milestones
- When component architecture changes

### Writing Effective Handoffs
- Include specific accomplishments with evidence
- Note current blockers and their impact
- Provide clear next steps for continuation
- Reference specific files and line numbers changed

### State Management
- Update state.md when changing project focus
- Log blockers immediately when encountered
- Resolve blockers with detailed solutions
- Keep state current and actionable

## Troubleshooting

### Python Tools Not Working
```bash
# Ensure Python 3 is available
python3 --version

# Make tools executable
chmod +x .agent/tools/*.py

# Run from project root
cd /path/to/pub-sub-demo
```

### Make Commands Not Found
```bash
# Ensure you're in project root
pwd  # Should show .../pub-sub-demo

# Check Makefile exists
ls -la Makefile

# Test make command
make help
```

### Progress Not Updating
```bash
# Check JSON syntax
python3 -m json.tool .agent/current/progress.json

# Verify file permissions
ls -la .agent/current/

# Test tool directly
python3 .agent/tools/update-progress.py
```

## Adaptation from AuStdX
