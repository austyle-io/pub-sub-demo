3. **Create project tracking** (GitHub issues/project board)
4. **Assign team members** to high-priority tasks
5. **Set up monitoring** for memory usage and performance
6. **Begin with testing infrastructure** setup using React Testing Library patterns

### Communication Plan

## Conclusion

The map module is well-architected but needs focused attention on testing, memory management, and completion of implementations before production deployment. The roadmap provides a clear path to address all identified issues while maintaining development velocity and code quality.

**Streamlined Approach**: We've separated core functionality (high/medium/low priority) from nice-to-have enhancements (Good Idea Fairy). This allows teams to focus on production-critical work while providing a menu of valuable one-day implementations for sprint buffers, hackathons, or learning exercises.

**Recommendation**:

1. Begin immediately with high-priority items (production blocking)
2. Schedule medium and low-priority items based on team capacity
3. Use Good Idea Fairy items as flexible sprint fillers and learning opportunities
