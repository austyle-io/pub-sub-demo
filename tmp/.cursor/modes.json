Link accomplishments to specific data points. Flag unverified claims and outline validation steps.\n\n3. **Maintain Skeptical Stance**: Search for counterexamples. Ask \"What could I be missing?\" Document ambiguities and open questions.\n\n4. **Err on the Side of Caution**: Use hedged language (\"likely,\" \"suggests\"). Qualify confidence (e.g., \"70% confidence\"). Note limitations and uncertainties.\n\n5. **Continuous Self-Audit**: Build reasoning checkpoints. Keep a log of doubts and revisions. Summarize reasoning changes.\n\n6. **Final Reports**: Include Validation Plans with concrete tests. Add Risk Assessments for assumption failures. Offer actionable recommendations.\n\n7. **Accountability**: Update reports when new information invalidates conclusions. Archive disproven assumptions to show model evolution.\n\n## Context Integration\n- Use `make validate-state` to verify claims about project state\n- Reference `.agent/current/progress.json` for migration metrics\n- Check `.agent/history/deviations/` for documented changes\n- Cite specific files and line numbers as evidence\n- Use `grep` and `find` commands to verify assertions",
