## Context

Project achievements to document:
{{selection}}

Specific areas to update:
{{input:documentation_areas}}

## Rules

### **Quantifiable Achievements**
- Include specific metrics (e.g., "5.3x coverage increase", "100% error resolution", "83% pass rate")
- Document before/after comparisons with concrete numbers
- Highlight ROI and efficiency gains with measurable data
- Reference success rates and performance benchmarks

### **Battle-Tested Patterns**
- Document patterns that have proven successful in production
- Include anti-patterns that failed with specific reasons why
- Provide concrete code examples from real implementations
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers where applicable

### **Comprehensive Knowledge Preservation**
- Capture critical discoveries that must not be lost
- Document lessons learned that prevent future failures
- Include step-by-step implementation guides
- Preserve context around architectural decisions

### **Enterprise-Grade Standards**
- Emphasize reliability, scalability, and maintainability achievements
- Document compliance with industry standards
- Include framework compatibility and future-proofing measures
- Highlight team collaboration and onboarding improvements

### **Documentation Organization**
- Update docs/project-overview.mdx with high-level achievements
- Create/update comprehensive guides in `/docs/`
- Update relevant prompts in `.cursor/prompts/`
- Ensure cross-references between related documentation

## Output Structure

1. **Main README Updates** - High-level achievements and metrics
2. **Detailed Implementation Guides** - Step-by-step technical documentation
3. **Lessons Learned Documentation** - Critical insights and anti-patterns
4. **Quick Reference Guides** - Developer-friendly cheat sheets
5. **Prompt Updates** - Enhanced AI prompts incorporating new knowledge
6. **Cross-Reference Updates** - Links between related documentation

## Examples of Quantifiable Metrics to Include

- **Error Resolution**: "75+ ESLint and TypeScript errors → 0 errors (100% compliance)"
- **Coverage Growth**: "1,286 → 6,800+ lines of tests (5.3x increase)"
- **Code Efficiency**: "40% reduction in test code through shared utilities"
- **Success Rates**: "371 tests with 83% pass rate across 8 test files"
- **Performance**: "Sub-50ms execution with configurable thresholds"
- **Bug Discovery**: "29 implementation bugs discovered through proper typing"

## Focus Areas

- **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test coverage, utilities, and patterns
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript compliance and error resolution
- **Developer Experience** - Tools, utilities, and workflow improvements
- **Architecture** - Scalable patterns and organizational improvements
- **Performance** - Measurable optimizations and benchmarks
- **Documentation** - Knowledge preservation and team onboarding

Ensure all updates reflect the enterprise-grade quality and battle-tested nature of the implementations, with emphasis on preserving knowledge for future team success.
