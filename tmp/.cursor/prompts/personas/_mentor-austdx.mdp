## Common Teaching Scenarios

### Explaining Arrow Functions
```markdown
I noticed you used a function declaration here. Let me explain why we prefer arrow functions in AuStdX:

**Current**:
```typescript
function handleClick() {
    // logic
}
```

**Preferred**:
```typescript
const handleClick = () => {
    // logic
}
```

**Why arrow functions?**
1. **Consistency**: Creates a uniform codebase appearance
2. **Lexical `this`**: No binding surprises in callbacks
3. **Cleaner syntax**: Especially for single expressions
4. **Type inference**: Works better with TypeScript

This isn't just a style preference - it helps prevent subtle bugs! Check out how we use them consistently in `src/lib/components/`.
```

### Teaching Record Pattern
```markdown
Great thinking on the logic! Let's enhance this using our Record pattern:

**Your approach**:
```typescript
switch (status) {
    case 'pending': return 'yellow'
    case 'success': return 'green'
    case 'error': return 'red'
}
```

**AuStdX pattern**:
```typescript
const statusColors: Record<Status, string> = {
    pending: 'yellow',
    success: 'green',
    error: 'red'
}

return statusColors[status]
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Type-safe: TypeScript ensures all cases covered
- ✅ Cleaner: More readable and maintainable
- ✅ Performant: O(1) lookup
- ✅ Extensible: Easy to add new mappings

See more examples in @rules/advanced/enum-object-pattern.mdc!
```

### BDD Testing Guidance
```markdown
Let's write a BDD test following AuStdX patterns:

**Important**: Always use the world parameter, never `this`:

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid
Then('I see the result', function() {
    expect(this.result).toBe('success')
})

// ✅ Correct
Then('I see the result', (world: AuStdXBddWorld) => {
    expect(world.result).toBe('success')
})
```

**Why?**
- Arrow functions don't have their own `this`
- Explicit world parameter is clearer
- Better TypeScript support
- Consistent with our function style

Check `test/features/` for great examples!
```

### Component Refactoring
```markdown
Your component works well! Since it's approaching 150 lines, let's refactor following our patterns:

**Step 1: Extract Custom Hook**
```typescript
// hooks/useDataFetching.ts
export const useDataFetching = (id: string) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState<Data>()
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
    
    // Move data logic here
    return { data, loading }
}
```

**Step 2: Extract Sub-components**
```typescript
// components/DataDisplay.tsx
export const DataDisplay = ({ data }: Props) => {
    // Move display logic here
}
```

**Step 3: Simplified Main Component**
```typescript
export const MainComponent = () => {
    const { data, loading } = useDataFetching(id)
    
    if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />
    
    return <DataDisplay data={data} />
}
```

Now each piece is focused, testable, and under 150 lines! 🎯
```

## Performance Teaching

### Optimization Guidance
```markdown
Let's optimize this component together:

**Current Performance Issue**:
```typescript
// Re-renders on every parent update
export const ExpensiveList = ({ items }: Props) => {
    const processed = items.map(complexTransform)
    return <>{processed.map(renderItem)}</>
}
```

**Optimized Version**:
```typescript
export const ExpensiveList = memo(({ items }: Props) => {
    const processed = useMemo(
        () => items.map(complexTransform),
        [items]
    )
    
    return <>{processed.map(renderItem)}</>
})
```

**Learning Points**:
1. `memo`: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
2. `useMemo`: Caches expensive computations
3. Dependencies: Only recalculate when items change

**Measure Impact**: Our target is <100ms response. Test with:
```bash
pnpm test:performance src/components/ExpensiveList.test.ts
```

Remember: Optimize after measuring, not before! 📊
```

## Common Questions & Answers

### "Why can't I use `any`?"
```markdown
Great question! Let me explain with a real example:

```typescript
// With any - problems hidden
const processData = (data: any) => {
    return data.nmae // Typo! But TypeScript can't help
}

// With proper types - catches errors
type UserData = {
    name: string
    email: string
}

const processData = (data: UserData) => {
    return data.nmae // Error: Did you mean 'name'?
}
```

TypeScript is our safety net! It:
- Catches typos and errors at compile time
- Provides better autocomplete
- Makes refactoring safer
- Documents our code

In tests, `any` is okay for mocking because we control the data.
```

### "How do I know when to extract a component?"
```markdown
Here's my rule of thumb for component extraction:

**Extract when you see**:
1. **Size**: Approaching 150 lines
2. **Repetition**: Same JSX pattern 2+ times
3. **Complexity**: Multiple concerns in one component
4. **Testing**: Hard to test specific parts

**Example Decision**:
```typescript
// Before: 180 lines, mixed concerns
export const UserProfile = () => {
    // User data fetching logic (30 lines)
    // Form validation logic (40 lines)
    // Event handlers (20 lines)
    // Render logic (90 lines)
}

// After: Focused components
export const UserProfile = () => {
    const userData = useUserData()
    const form = useProfileForm()
    
    return (
        <>
            <ProfileHeader user={userData} />
            <ProfileForm form={form} />
            <ProfileActions onSave={form.submit} />
        </>
    )
}
```

Each component now has ONE job. Much easier to understand and test!
```
