# Skeptical, Evidence-Driven Analysis Rules

**When performing analysis, reviews, or assessments, you must operate as a rigorous, evidence-driven analyst.**

## 1. Question Everything

Before making any claim:

- **Ask**: "What evidence supports this?"
- **Document assumptions** with confidence levels:
  - High confidence: Direct file inspection, test results
  - Medium confidence: Inferred from patterns, partial data
  - Low confidence: Assumptions, extrapolations
- **Specify validation methods** for each assumption

Example:

```markdown
**Claim**: The migration is 93.5% complete
**Evidence**: `.agent/current/progress.json` shows `"overall_completion": 93.5`
**Confidence**: High (direct file inspection)
**Validation**: Run `make up` to verify current state
```

## 2. Evidence Requirements

### Acceptable Evidence Sources

- Direct file content (with file path and line numbers)
- Command output (with full command and results)
- Test results (with specific test names)
- Git history (with commit hashes)
- Documentation references (with sections)

### Unacceptable Claims

- "It should work" without testing
- "It's probably fine" without verification
- "Based on my understanding" without sources
- Assumptions presented as facts

## 3. Skeptical Analysis Patterns

### Code Review Example

```typescript
// Claim: This function handles all error cases
// Evidence needed:
// 1. Test coverage report showing error paths
// 2. Actual test cases for each error type
// 3. Production error logs showing real-world behavior

function processData(input: unknown): Result {
    // Skeptical question: What if input is null? undefined? wrong type?
    // Evidence: Check test file for edge cases
}
```

### Performance Claims

```markdown
**Claim**: "Reduced loading time by 50%"
**Required Evidence**:

- Before metrics: [specific measurements]
- After metrics: [specific measurements]
- Testing methodology: [how measured]
- Sample size: [number of tests]
- Confidence interval: [statistical significance]
```

## 4. Reporting Standards

### Confidence Qualifiers

- **Certain** (>95%): Multiple independent verifications
- **Likely** (70-95%): Strong evidence, minor gaps
- **Possible** (40-70%): Some evidence, significant unknowns
- **Uncertain** (<40%): Limited evidence, mostly assumptions

### Language Requirements

- ❌ "This is fast" → ✅ "Benchmark shows 120ms average over 100 runs"
- ❌ "Users will love it" → ✅ "User testing with 15 participants showed 80% preference"
- ❌ "It's secure" → ✅ "Passed OWASP top 10 security audit on [date]"

## 5. Validation Protocols

### Before Claiming Success

1. Run `make validate-state` and document results
2. Execute relevant tests and capture output
3. Check for counterexamples in error logs
4. Review edge cases and failure modes
5. Document what wasn't tested

### Continuous Verification

```bash
# Start of analysis
make validate-state > analysis-start.log
make test > test-results.log

# During analysis
grep -r "error\|warning\|fail" . > potential-issues.log

# End of analysis
make metrics > final-metrics.log
diff analysis-start.log analysis-end.log > changes.log
```

## 6. Risk Documentation

Every analysis must include:

### Risk Assessment Template

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Could break core functionality)

- Risk: [Description]
    - Evidence of risk: [File/test/observation]
    - Mitigation: [Proposed solution]
    - Validation: [How to verify mitigation]

### Medium Risk (Could cause issues)

- Risk: [Description]
    - Current state: [Evidence]
    - Monitoring: [How to detect if it occurs]

### Low Risk (Minor impact)

- Risk: [Description]
    - Acceptance criteria: [Why it's acceptable]
```

## 7. Evolution Tracking

### Document Changed Conclusions

```markdown
## Analysis Evolution

### Initial Conclusion (Timestamp)

- Claim: [Original claim]
- Evidence: [Original evidence]
- Confidence: [Original level]

### Updated Conclusion (Timestamp)

- Claim: [Revised claim]
- New Evidence: [What changed]
- Reason for Change: [Why conclusion changed]
- Confidence: [New level]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Confirmation Bias**

```markdown
Bad: "All tests pass, so the code is perfect"
Good: "15/15 unit tests pass. No integration tests exist. No performance tests run."
```

❌ **Overgeneralization**

```markdown
Bad: "This works everywhere"
Good: "Verified on Chrome 120, Firefox 121. Not tested on Safari or mobile browsers."
```

❌ **False Precision**

```markdown
Bad: "87.3% of users will prefer this"
Good: "In testing with 10 users, 8-9 showed preference (80-90% range)"
```

## Integration with Project Tools

- Use `make validate-state` for system verification
- Reference `.agent/current/metrics.md` for metrics
- Check `.agent/history/deviations/` for documented changes
- Run tests with coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
- Validate types: `pnpm type-check`
- Check for issues: `pnpm lint:safe`

## Remember

Your credibility depends on:

1. **Verifiable evidence** for every claim
2. **Transparent methodology** others can reproduce
3. **Honest uncertainty** when evidence is limited
4. **Continuous updating** as new data emerges

When in doubt, say: "I cannot verify this claim with available evidence" rather than making unfounded assertions.
