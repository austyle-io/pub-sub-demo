## ðŸ”§ **Key Patterns Enforced**

### Union Literals with Constants

```typescript
export const STATUS = { PENDING: "pending", COMPLETE: "complete" } as const;
export type Status = (typeof STATUS)[keyof typeof STATUS];
```

### Component Architecture

```typescript
type ComponentProps = { title: string; onClick?: () => void; };
export const Component = ({ title, onClick }: ComponentProps) => {
  const handleClick = () => onClick?.();
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{title}</button>;
};
```

### Generic Type-Safe Utilities

```typescript
const groupBy = <T, K extends keyof T>(array: T[], key: K): Record<string, T[]> => {
    return array.reduce(
        (groups, item) => {
            const groupKey = String(item[key]);
            groups[groupKey] = groups[groupKey] || [];
            groups[groupKey].push(item);
            return groups;
        },
        {} as Record<string, T[]>,
    );
};
```

### Error Boundaries with Context

```typescript
const CustomErrorBoundary = ({ children, ...props }: CustomErrorBoundaryProps) => {
  return (
    <ReactErrorBoundary
      fallbackRender={({ ...fallbackProps }) => {
        const resetErrorBoundaryProps = { ...fallbackProps, ...props };
        return <ResetErrorBoundary {...resetErrorBoundaryProps} />;
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ReactErrorBoundary>
  );
};
```

### Context Provider Patterns

```typescript
const StoreContext = createContext<Store | null>(null);
export const StoreProvider = ({ children }) => (
  <StoreContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</StoreContext.Provider>
);
export const useStore = () => {
  const context = useContext(StoreContext);
  if (!context) throw new Error('useStore must be used within StoreProvider');
  return context;
};
```

## ðŸš€ **Benefits**

- **Modular**: Include only relevant rules for specific tasks
- **Organized**: Logical categorization and easy navigation
- **Maintainable**: Update individual rules without affecting others
- **Comprehensive**: Complete coverage of coding standards
- **Battle-Tested**: Derived from successful real-world implementations
- **Consistent**: Enforces architectural patterns across entire codebase

## ðŸŽ“ **Implementation History**

These rules were derived from successful reorganization of:

- **Layer Management Widget**: Refactored from 5 monolithic files (2,786 lines) to 16 focused modules
- **Map System Architecture**: Established patterns for file organization and component extraction
- **State Management**: Developed context provider patterns and store organization
- **Type Safety**: Created union literal patterns and Zod validation approaches
- **Code Quality**: Developed error handling, testing, and compliance patterns

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**

- **File Size Compliance**: Target sizes met across all categories
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- **Maintainability**: Changes isolated to specific domains
- **Developer Experience**: Faster navigation and comprehension
- **Type Safety**: Runtime and compile-time validation patterns
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive coverage of quality concerns

Use these rules to maintain the high code quality and organizational standards established through proven architectural decisions.
